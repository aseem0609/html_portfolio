<h2>2018</h2>
<p>This was the first time I went to a movie theater. My first movie experience will probably be the best movie experience.</p>
<h3>1. Avengers : Infinity War</h3>
<p>
    This is probably the best Avengers movie if not the best (behind Endgame). The experience when Thor arrives in Wakanda, I was literally shaking while sitting on my seat. This is my best ever theater experience and will probably be always be. Everything in the movie is good, the story, the pace, the build up for the next and final movie of phase 3. Absolute masterpiece. My rating for this movie will be 9.5/10

<h2>2019</h2>
<p>
    Watched a lot of movies in this year, as I got my college and was new to theater experience. But my year ended with a bad movie experience.
</p>
<h3>1. Captain Marvel</h3>
<p>
    Nice CGI fights, good concept but people didn't give it proper value because the greatest movie of all time Avengers : Endgame was about to arrive. I didn't watch that in theater because of my JEE Advanced Exam. But this captain marvel movie is a good one. The side charachters are also good. Nick fury and Flekran the Cat was good. My rating 7/10. 
</p>
<h3>2. Badla</h3>
<p>
    Can't remember the movie for now but I remember the twists in this movie was like no other. I kept thinking about this movie for months to come. Mesmerising Tapsee Pannu and always amazing Amitabh Bachhan was in this movie. My rating 8/10
</p>
<h3>3. RAW : Romeo, Akbar, Walter</h3>
<p>
    At that time I liked the movie very much. It dealth with Bangladesh war in 1970s. Good movie, good concept but the hype was missing. My rating 7/10.
</p>
<h3>4. Commando 3</h3>
<p>
    Not a good movie. I don't want to remember the movie to write the review. Just giving the rating 3.5/10.

<h2>2021</h2>
<h3>1. Shang Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings</h3>
<p>
    A very very impressive movie. One of the best stand alone movie from Marvel. I can't wait for part 2 of this Shang Chi movies. My rating 8/10.
</p>
<h3>2. Spider-Man : No way Home</h3>
<p>
    This movie will be remembered in the history of movie making that involves Multiverse. What an idea to bring three different spiderman and all the villains. The cinema is pure entertainment and fan service. My rating 9/10

<h2>2022</h2>
<h3>1. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h3>
<p>
    A good movie, real madness. Must watch. My rating 8/10.
</p>
<h3>2. Thor : Love and Thunder</h3>
<p>
    Absolute worse movie, Nothing was good in this movie. My rating 1.5/10
</p>
<h3>3. Black Panther : Wakanda Forever</h3>
<p>
    Just an average movie. People were emotional beacause the original actor for Black Panther part 1 was dead and unavailable for this movie but that should't affect your thoughts on this movie. Unnecessary deaths in this movie was not so good. My rating 6.5/10.

<h2>2023</h2>
<h3>1. Pathan </h3>
<p>
    This was SRK's first movie since his 5 year break from BOLLYWOOD. For me it was average but people liked it and the movie grossed 1000cr+. The hype and craziness was unreal in theater. The movie did create controversy but overall rating from me will be 6/10.
</p>
<h3>2. Ant man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h3>
<p>
    This was an absolute crazy movie. They explored the Quantum world. I enjoyed the movie very much and the post credit scene is also awesome. I already had spoilers about the post credit scene but still I shouted very loud when I saw the post credit scene. The movie was also awesome. The creatures which was shown in Quantum realm was interesting and crazy af. The real fear of Kang was shown in the movie. But the critics and other audience didn't like it very much so it was not so hit like other Marvel movies. One of the imporant movie from the trip to theater would be that I was bitten by a very large and scary ANT after we came out of theater and my friends and me were joking that now I would become ANTMAN. The sting was a bit painful though. My rating 7.5/10.
</p>
<h3>3. Evil Dead Rise</h3>
<p>
    There is nothing special in this movie. Its more gross than being Scary. My rating 5.5/10
</p>
<h3>4. Dunki: </h3>
<p>
    I will go to watch Dunki by SRK. If not in Patna then surely in Kharagpur. Heard a lot of good reviews and it is also my favourite director directing it. Will post the review here as soon as I watch it.
